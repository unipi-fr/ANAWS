# ANAWS

This repository was made for hosting all files and instructions to build the network described in the [specification file](./doc/Project%20specifications%20(Group%204).pdf "Specification File")\*

\*: the final specification are changed, since with only ONOS and BGP was not possibile implement the routing policy.<br>At the end:
- R1 only knows AS2
- R2 only knows AS3
- R3 only knows AS1
- R4 only knows AS1
- R5 knows both AS1 and AS2

### Start with [setup enviroment](./doc/tutorials/setup-enviroment.md "setup-enviroment.md") or check the [project configuration](./doc/tutorials/project-configuration.md "project-configuration.md")
